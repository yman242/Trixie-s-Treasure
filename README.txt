This is the game made for the Global Game Jam in 48 hours.

Trixie's Treasure needs XNA to run. This project was a group effort with both Brandon Anderson and myself doing the programming. I did most the things involving getting the character to work right, and he did the level creation. We split the rest. None of the art was done by us. 

To win just walk to the left right off the cliff.
